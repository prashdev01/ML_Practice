    "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model performs extremely well on the training data but fails to generalize well on unseen or new data. It happens when the model learns to memorize the noise and specific patterns in the training data instead of capturing the underlying relationships between features and the target variable. To reduce overfitting, several techniques can be employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cross-validation:** Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the training data. This helps to get a more reliable estimate of the model's generalization performance.\n",
